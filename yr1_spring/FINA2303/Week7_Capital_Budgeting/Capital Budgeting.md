## Incremental Cash Flow
- Cash flows that occur only because we are undertaking the project.
- Only incremental cash flows are relevant for capital budgeting
## Three Types of Cash Flow

|Initial Outlay | On-Going CF | Terminal CF |
| --- | --- | --- |
|  t=0   |   t=1 ... t=N-1  | t=N|

### Initial Outlay
- No need to estimate future cash flow
- Exclude sunk costs
- Include changes in working capital: e.g. inventory kept in stock to cover future incremental sales
### On-Going (Incremental) Free Cash Flows
Cash flows that are "Free" to be split between debt holders and shareholders

|  | Revenue |
|-|---|
|-|Cost of Good Sold|
|=|**Gross Profit**    |
|-|Selling, General, and Admin. Expense (SG&A)  |
|-|Depreciation|
|=|**EBIT**|
|-|Income tax|
|=|**Incremental Earnings**|
|+|Depreciation|
|-|Capital Expenditure|
|-|Increase in Working Capital|
|=|**Incremental FCF**|
- Interest expense is not included in FCF calculation
- Incremental income taxes = EBIT $\times$ firm's marginal corporate tax rate
- Depreciation is not a cash flow, but the taxes we save thanks to depreciation are cash flows
- Net working capital = Inventory + Accounts Receivable - Accounts Payable
- Working capital investment is recovered at the end of the project
## Terminal Cash Flows
- Working capital recovery/loss
- Shut-down costs (tax-deductible)
- After-tax liquidation value = Proceeds from sales of assets - Capital Gain or Loss $\times$ Tax rate
- Capital gain/Loss = |Proceeds from sales - Residual book value|
## Opportunity Costs
separately compute and compare NPV of different investment alternatives
## Externalities
Differential cash flows caused by externalities need to be included in FCF analysis.
