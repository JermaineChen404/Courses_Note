# Capital Structure Theory
- ROE: Return on Earning
- EPS: Earning per Share
- Cost of Capital $\iff$ Riskiness of the cash flow
## Effect of Leverage
- Leverage amplifies the variation in both ROE and EPS
- Capital structure affects the value of the firm through
  - Cost of Capital
  - Cash Flow
$$\sum \frac{FCF_{n}}{(1+R_{wacc})^n}$$
## Three Special Cases
- Case I
	- No corporate or personal taxes
	- No bankruptcy costs
- Case II
	- Corporate taxes, but no personal taxes
	- No bankruptcy costs
- Case III
	- Corporate taxes, but no personal taxes
	- Bankruptcy costs
## Case I
### Assumption
[[Ust_Note/yr2_Fall/FINA3303/Capital Structure#Perfect Capital Market|Perfect capital market]]
- No corporate or personal taxes
- No bankruptcy costs
### Proposition I - Firm Value
$V_{L}=V_{U}=D+E$
- How cash flow is divided  between bondholders and shareholders doesn't affect the value of the firm
### Proposition II - WACC
$R_{U}=R_{wacc}=\frac{E}{D+E}\times R_{E}+\frac{D}{D+E}\times R_{D}$
- Given a fixed FCFF, $R_{wacc}$ is a constant
	- $R_{wacc}$ can be interpreted as
		- cost of the firm's business risk
		- the risk of the firm's assets
	- $R_{E}=R_{U}+\frac{D}{E}(R_{U}-R_{D})$
		- ![[Ust_Note/yr2_Fall/FINA3303/attachments/Pasted image 20250912122854.png]]
		- More debt, more volatile, higher required return on levered equity
- When $\frac{D}{V}$ is very high

## Case II
### Assumption
- Corporate taxes, but no personal taxes
- No bankruptcy costs

Cash flow is divided among bondholders, shareholders, and government (tax)
### Proposition I - Firm Value
- $PV=DT_{C}$
	- Present value of annual interest tax shield
		- interest tax shield = tax rate $\times$ interest payment
			- $its=T_{C}\times D\times R_{D}$
		- assume perpetual debt
			- $PV=\frac{its}{R_{D}}=DT_{C}$
- $V_{L}=V_{U}+DT_{C}$
	- Value of a levered firm = value of an unlevered firm $+$ PV of interest tax shield
	- ![[Ust_Note/yr2_Fall/FINA3303/attachments/Pasted image 20250912125435.png]]
### Proposition II - WACC
- $R_{wacc}=R_{U}-\frac{D}{D+E}\times R_{D}\times T_{C}$
## Case III


## Perfect Capital Market
- Securities are fairly prices (no bid-ask spread)
- No tax, no transaction costs
- Investment cash flows are independent of financing choices
## Homemade Leverage
Investors can create homemade leverages for their portfolio regardless of how a specific firm leverages to achieve their desired debt/equity ratio.
- Assumptions: Same interest rate for investors and firms (valid in perfect market assumption)
- To leverage $\to$ borrow money to buy stocks
- To deleverage $\to$ sell stocks to buy bonds (lend money)
- Goal: Maintain the desired debt/equity ratio


## Tax cut
- Lower tax shield $\to$ less debt
- Stronger ability to repay debt $\to$ more debt

## Assumption
- $B_{its}=B_{U}$
	- when D/V is constant
	- $its=r_{d}\times D_{t}\times T_{c}=r_{d} \times \frac{D}{V}\times V\times T_{c}$

- In exam, formula I and II if not specified
- Positive NPV Projects $\to$ stock price rise
