## 🎨 Avant-gardes in Contemporary Culture

Three pertinent branches, their manifestos, and authors:

1. **Artificialism** (Czech interwar)—manifesto by **Jindřich Štyrský & Toyen**, calling for “reverse perspective” and internal imagery over representational realism ([anarchistbookfair.cz](https://anarchistbookfair.cz/2023/distros?utm_source=chatgpt.com "Anarchistický festival knihy 2023 | Stalls"), [elementymag.art](https://elementymag.art/en/niebezpieczne-krajobrazy-awangarda-i-okultyzm-w-europie-srodkowej/?utm_source=chatgpt.com "DANGEROUS TERRITORY. THE AVANT-GARDE AND OCCULTISM IN CENTRAL EUROPE — ELEMENTYmag")).
    
2. **Poetism** (Devětsil, Czech 1920s)—Karel Teige’s manifesto promoting joy, collage of everyday life, blending arts into leisure and play ([peterlang.com](https://www.peterlang.com/document/1051537?utm_source=chatgpt.com "The Czech Avant-Garde Literary Movement Between the World Wars - Peter Lang Verlag")).
    
3. **Happening/Ludism** (1960s Europe)—manifesto in Milan Knížák’s actions like “A Game of War” (1965), asserting everyday life as art ([vdoc.pub](https://vdoc.pub/documents/postmodernism-and-the-postsocialist-condition-politicized-art-under-late-socialism-ahmanson-murphy-fine-arts-book-7fp9ijqtihn0?utm_source=chatgpt.com "Postmodernism And The Postsocialist Condition: Politicized Art Under Late Socialism (ahmanson-murphy Fine Arts Book) [PDF] [7fp9ijqtihn0]")).

## Graffiti Artists & Genres

**Five artists**:

**Banksy’s theories** (from _Wall and Piece_): graffiti is social commentary; stencils enable quick, repeatable acts; anonymity is political; art as activism.

**Three Banksy projects**:  
– _Girl with Balloon_ shred-stunt at Sotheby’s (2018) ([en.wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Banksy?utm_source=chatgpt.com "Banksy"))

– _Mobile Lovers_ doorway painting sold to support youth club ([en.wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Banksy?utm_source=chatgpt.com "Banksy"))

**Business strategy**: operates anonymously but monetizes through prints, auctions, brand collaborations, and staged interventions.
